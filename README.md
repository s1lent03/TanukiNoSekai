Tanuki no Sekai (translated to Tanuki World) is a creature catching, RPG & Turn-based Strategy game, where the main objective is to liberate all 5 towns from the evil alien Tanukis. This is done by catching and training your Tanuki (creatures with powers) so that they're strong enough to defeat all 5 elemental bosses.
