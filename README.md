# Tanuki No Sekai

Tanuki no Sekai (translated to Tanuki World) is a creature catching, RPG & Turn-based Strategy game, where the main objective is to liberate all 5 towns from the evil alien Tanukis. This is done by catching and training your Tanuki (creatures with powers) so that they're strong enough to defeat all 5 elemental bosses.

## Mechanics

### Catching

To catch a wild Tanuki, the player needs to throw a Catching Ball at one and it might get stunned by it. If it does, then the player needs to get close to it and give it a berry and if it works, the player captures the wild Tanuki and can use it in battles, if it doesn't, the Tanuki will go after the player to engage in battle.

### Battling

To battle a wild Tanuki the player either hits it with a Catching Ball and it doesn't work, or it does work but the Tanuki doesn't get caught when the player gives it a berry and goes after the player to engage in battle.

### Day-night Cycle

The day-night cycle works with an in-game timer, but it can also work with the user's system current time.
